In this paper, we present short-term forecasts of COVID-19 for 28 Indian states and five union territories using realtime data from 30 January to 21 April 2020. Applying Holt's second-order exponential smoothing method and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, we generate 10-day ahead forecasts of the likely number of infected cases and deaths in India for 22 April to 1 May 2020. Our results show that the number of cumulative cases in India will rise to 36335.63 [PI 95% (30884.56, 42918.87)], concurrently the number of deaths may increase to 1099.38 [PI 95% (959.77, 1553.76)] by 1 May 2020. Further, we have divided the country into severity zones based on the cumulative cases. According to this analysis, Maharashtra is likely to be the most affected states with around 9787.24 [PI 95% (6949.81, 13757.06)] cumulative cases by 1 May 2020. However, Kerala and Karnataka are likely to shift from the red zone (i.e. highly affected) to the lesser affected region. On the other hand, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh will move to the red zone. These results mark the states where lockdown by 3 May 2020, can be loosened.",

            "text": "COVID-19 illness, an on-going epidemic, started in Wuhan city, China, in December 2019 continues to cause infections in many countries around the world [1] . Considering the scale and speed of transmission of COVID-19, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a pandemic [2] . Thereafter, COVID-19 has become a threat to human life on the planet. It has shown rapid infections in almost all countries, and there is no cure available for this deadly virus. Presently governments have issued precautionary measures such as social distancing, sanitization of streets and markets, quarantine of suspected and infected cases, and lockdown of the communities at different scales (colonies, towns, states, and countries, etc.). In India, exponential growth has not been observed as compared to the USA and other European countries. It is due to the measures taken by the Indian government. It indicates that there is a strong influence of these measures, such as lockdown on the transmission behavior of COVID-19. On the other side, these measures create substantial economic losses to the communities, and hence actions mentioned above cannot be imposed for longer periods. Mainly, developing countries (such as India) cannot afford such payoff after some finite time. The Indian government has continuously reviewed every hour situation in every state. The government has become more focused on localizing the lockdown in particularly alarming states and few towns which are hotspots for COVID- 19 . For all these, it is important to have short-term forecasts which can be steering point for decision-makers and administrations. In this connection, data-based statistical models such as Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Holts method have shown effectiveness in predicting short-term forecast including the dengue fever [3, 4] , the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [5] , Tuberculosis [6] and COVID-19 [7] . ARIMA has more ability compared to other prediction models like the support vector machine and wavelet neural network for drought forecasting [8] . Also, exponential smoothing methods have been widely used for forecasting of the population in West Java [9] , an inflation rate of Zambia [10] including a prediction for epidemic mumps [11] and COVID-19 [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, mainly, for India, the short-term forecast is not done thoroughly. As India has diversity across the states, it will be essential to study the spreading behavior of COVID-19 in different Indian states. This article presents a short-term forecast for various Indian states which are severely infected.",

It gives direction to the researcher for choosing an appropriate modeling approach that directly captures identified features. Before starting the procedure, there is a need to make the time series stationary. To stabilize the variance, we used square root transformation on the infected number of cases per day time series. For investigating the stationarity of time series, we take the support of the KPSS and ADF test, and results are shown in Table 1 . The first difference of series, i.e. d=1, is optimum to make series reasonably stationary. Based on a 5% significance level both the tests, ADF and KPSS, reject the hypothesis of stationarity of time series without making any difference. Afterwards taking the first difference, both the criteria agree on the stationarity of time series. Further, to estimate another two parameters of the candidate model, the ACF and PACF of series, first difference, and square root transformation are used. From Figure 2 (a) and 2(b), the ACF display one spike, and the PACF also displays one spike. Initially, on the bases of the number of spikes, we selected ARIMA(1, 1, 1). Alternate models are also used to compete with the ARIMA(1,1,1) model. All alternative models and their AIC values with the Ljung-Box test p-values are shown in Table 2 . A model with a minimal amount of AIC is to have well-behaved residuals. Finally, we select ARIMA(1,1,2) for forecasting. In terms of the residuals, the ARIMA(1,1,2) model passed the Ljung-Box test with p-values larger than 0.05 level of significance. Since ARIMA(1,1,2) has the lowest AIC value, which means the residuals of ARIMA(1,1,2) are much well behaved compared to other considered models. We examine that all the residuals are scattered around zero mean with constant variance. Using this, ARIMA(1,1,2) model observe 36335.53 [95% PI(30884.56 -42918.87)] cumulative infected cases between by 1 May2020, results are shown in Table 3 . Since only one difference makes the time series stationary, we conclude to take d=1. Results of ADF and KPSS tests are presented in Table 4 . From Figure 2 (c) and 2(d), ACF demonstrates two significant spikes, and PACF demonstrates zero significant spike. Based on the number of spikes, we selected ARIMA (0, 1, 2) . Alternate models were also used to compete with the ARIMA (0,1,2) model. Details of other potential models along with AIC values and Ljung-Box test p-values given in Table 5 . Furthermore, to forecast the number of deaths per day in India, we found ARIMA (0,1,3) a reasonable model among other competitor models it has minimum AIC value. Furthermore, we found residuals are randomly scattered around zero mean with non-changing variance with time. Also, ARIMA(0,1,3) does not show a lack of fit with the Ljung-box test p-value larger than 0.05. Graphical results of forecasting from infected cases and deaths are shown in Figure 3 . Table 3 . To eliminate the effect of square root transformation in per day infected cases we take a square of forecasted observations. ",

To select the optimum ARIMA model for each state, firstly each state's time series is made stationary by taking differences. Next, we used ADF and KPSS tests to check stationarity. To stabilize the variance of Delhi, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat time series, cube root transformations are used; later, one difference is enough to remove the trend. While to stabilize the variance of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Rajasthan time series, square root and square transformations are used, respectively.The same procedure is adopted for all the tentime series of infected cases per day. AIC values are used to select the best models, and the model is chosen on the base of the smallest AIC value. Results of analysis for ARIMA models are shown in Table 9 . Analysis by ARIMA models shows that Maharashtra and Gujarat will be the most affected states by 1 May2020, with around 9787.24 and 4216cumulative cases, respectively. As we observe that Kerala's growth is declining and it will be less affected states with 449 [PI 95%(408-574.99)] cumulative cases. All the models passed the Ljung-Box test as well as does not show any lack of fit. It is found that Kerala and Karnataka were in the red zone, and Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were in the blue area until 1 April 2020 ( Figure 12 ). But they are likely to change their positioning by 1 May. Accordingly, Kerala and Karnataka will shift to the blue zone as cases are declining in both states. Conversely, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh will move to the red area. The government should impose extra precautions in these states, as the cases will significantly rise in both in the coming days. While lockdown should remain in the red zone, conversely, the blue area is not remarkably affected by COVID-19, so lockdown should be lifted with some restrictions.It is advisable to lift the lockdown in states within green and light green zones for the proper functioning of the economy.",

It reflects the influence of the broad spectrum of social distancing measures put in use by the government of India, which has played the role of a barrier to growing infected cases and deaths, apparently helped to slow down the epidemic growth. Our short-term forecast reveals that at the regional level, Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu will be the most affected states in the coming days. Considering the situation, lockdown should not be lifted in these states. The number of cases in Kerala and Karnataka is found to be reducing. Moreover, these states are shifted from the red zone to blue. Since very little growth in the future is predicted, lockdown may be lifted in these states with some restrictions for the proper functioning of economic activities. While states in green and light green zones, namely, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Uttrakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya show very less growth in the infected cases till 1 May, therefore, lockdown may be uplifted there. On India level, there will be around 36335.63 [95% PI(30884.56, 42918.87)] cases and 1099.38 [95% PI(959.77, 1553.76)] deaths up to 1 May 2020.
