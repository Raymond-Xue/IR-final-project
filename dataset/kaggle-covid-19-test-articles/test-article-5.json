(2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process-multi-site neutral)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially 'chaotic', unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M 0 ) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M 0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M 0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. For example, M 0 =5.758 (COVID-19, China, or 196=M 0 x34 in total) vs. M 0 =2.701 (COVID-19, World) vs. M 0 =9.475 (SARS, World) suggested",

This may indicate that COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters \u03b8 and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative 2 significance of \"infection through local contagion\" vs. \"infection through migration\", both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions. Third, comparing the levels of TPL-M 0 and \u03b8 may leverage the complementary nature of TPL analysis and metapopulation modeling. For example, their difference (\u03b8-M 0 =0.6) for the COVID-19 in China confirmed the critical importance of controlling migration (mobility) in suppressing the outbreak, although migration may have been a primary driving force for the initial outbreaks in several regions of China.",

TPL has been verified by hundreds if not thousands of field observations in nature (Taylor 2019), and it has also found cross-disciplinary applications beyond its original domains of biology and ecology in disciplines such as computer science, natural disaster modeling, and experimental physics (Eisler et al. 2008 , Ma 2012b , Tippett & Cohen 2016 , Helmrich et al. 2020 . Despite that TPL was proposed more than a half century ago (Taylor 1961) and there is not yet a consensus on the underlying mechanisms generating TPL (Eisler 2008 , Stumpf & Porter 2012 , there seems to be a recent resurgence of interests in this near universal model that captures the relationship between the population mean (m) and variance (V) in the form of a simple power function (i.e., V=am b ) (e.g., Cohen & Schuster 2012 , Cohen & Xu 2015 , Giometto et al. 2015 , Kalinin et al. 2018 , Oh et al. 2016 , Reuman et al. 2017 ). Among the numerous existing studies on TPL, there have already been its applications to the analyses of spatial variation of human population (Cohen et al. 2013) , human mortality (Bohk et al. 2015) , and epidemiology (Rhodes & Anderson 1996) . Given these previous applications to human demography and epidemiology, we postulate that TPL should also be applicable to the outbreak analyses of coronavirus infection diseases such as the still ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or COVID-19 (coronavirus-infected Pneumonia disease) (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) (Li et al. 2020 , Thompson et al. 2020 , Kucharski et al. 2020 , Zhang et al. 2020 and 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) (https://www.who.int/csr/sars). In the present report, we test this hypothesis and further explore possible epidemiological processes (mechanisms) underlying the outbreak of COVID-19 infections.",

Nevertheless, this can be rather challenging given the lack of controlled experimental data, which is ethically infeasible to collect obviously. In principle, all of the infections existing globally constitute a metapopulation of people infected by the coronavirus, but constructing standard epidemiological models (e.g., Wang et al. 2018 , Rivers et al. 2019 with existing data is rather difficult. We realized that Hubbell's (2001) neutral theory of biodiversity, which is one of the four major metacommunity models (the other three include species sorting, mass effect, and patch dynamics) (Rosindell et al. 2011 (Rosindell et al. , 2012 Vellend 2010 Vellend , 2016 , might be adapted to approximate the meta-population dynamics.

The advantage of the first approach is its computational simplicity and the advantage of the second or GMR is that it is more robust for small sample size (N<15 according to Clark and Perry 1995) . Both approaches preserve the scale invariance of power law. Regarding the second aspect or the interpretation of the TPL, there is controversy on the claim that TPL parameter (b) is species specific, in particular when there are changes in sampling method, life stage, environment or spatial scale (Taylor et al. 1988, Clark and Perry 1995) . Our opinion is that, unlike parameter a, parameter b is primarily shaped by evolutionary forces and less influenced by ecological or environmental factors. However, we do not take the \"invariance\" or \"constancy\" at ecological time scale or with environmental factors as granted. Instead, we draw conclusions based on rigorous statistical tests of the differences in parameter b among treatments. In the case of this study, we perform the permutation (randomization) test to judge whether or not the TPL parameters are invariant.

Since the level of Allee effects is still unknown, whether or not the infections under M 0 will die off is still an open question.",

The ratio of Q=133.581/6.325\u224821 (Table 2) indicating that spread via migration is approximately 21 times more significant than spread via local contagion on average nationally in China.

Therefore, the ratio Q is dependent on time (disease stages), space (regions), and disease-kinds (COVID-19 or SARS), and perhaps most importantly, public-health interventions such as quarantines and/or mobility control.",

We postulate that, when the \"local speciation (contagion)\" (\u03b8) approximates the population aggregation critical density or infection critical threshold (M 0 ), the infections could become random (suggesting a potentially stabilized infection level). That is, without inputs from external migration, local infections via local contagion (measured by \u03b8) could become random (as indicated by M 0 ). If this postulation is true, then it may suggest that the mobility control (such as travel restrictions or quarantines) can be critically effective in stabilizing outbreaks. This finding indicates the complementary nature of the two approaches we adopted in this study.

We postulate that M 0 should also be influenced by public-health interventions such as quarantines and travel restrictions. Therefore, M 0 can be an important epidemiological parameter for evaluating the characteristics of disease outbreaks. For example, COVID-19 exhibited significantly lower threshold (M 0 ) than SARS, suggesting a potentially lower infection \"tolerance\" threshold of COVID-19. Nevertheless, it should be cautioned that the \"tolerance\" threshold only means the level of random infections, which may signal the level of stabilized infections. However, whether or not the \"tolerance\" threshold is biometrically tolerable or safe depends on other biomedical characteristics, among which Allee effects can be a critical factor to determine whether or not the infections will die off or persist.

We then apply Hubbell's (2001) UNTB (specifically Harris et al. 2015 HDP-MSN model) to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus outbreak and to estimate the critical metapopulation parameters that may offer insights on the relative importance of migration vs. local contagion in driving or suppressing virus outbreaks. Furthermore, both TPL and metapopulation modeling complemented each other and revealed the five findings explained in the previous sections, from which we further summarize the following insights and discuss their implications below. First, the coronavirus infections, including both COVID-19 and SARS appear to possess characteristic stability parameter (b) values, slightly exceeding 2 in terms of the daily cumulative infections and exceeding 1 in terms of the daily incremental infections. As suggested by the literature of TPL, when the TPL parameter (b) exceeds 2, the population dynamics can be rather chaotic, indicating potentially chaotic behavior of coronavirus outbreaks. The TPL-b values for both the coronaviruses are at the high end of the b-value range in population ecology, compared with the b-values of most microbial and macrobial species in existing literature, which are usually b<2.",

In other words, \u03b8 measures the spread level from local contagion and M measures spread level from external migration. A third parameter migration probability (m) is a function of fundamental dispersal number (M), measures the probability of infections from migration. All three parameters can depend on disease kinds (COVID-19 or SARS), time (disease stage), space (regions), as well as public-health interventions (such as quarantines, mobility control and/or isolation for treatments).",

Note that the term aggregation at the population level can be considered as the counterpart of heterogeneity at the community level.In general, there are two important aspects related to the applications of TPL. First, test the fitting of the TPL model to the datasets under evaluations (such as SARS or COVID-19 infections). The testing determines the applicability of TPL based on well-established statistics such as p-value or R (linear correlation coefficient). Second, interpret the TPL parameters based",

In particular, when m=M 0 , it means that the population spatial distribution or temporal stability (variability) is random; when m<M 0 , the distribution or stability is regular or uniform. Whether or not the population may die off is uncertain. If m happens to coincide with the threshold of Allee effects, population (infections) may indeed die off.interpreted as the rate at which new individuals are added to the metacommunity due to speciation. The UNTB assumes that the SAD (species abundance distribution) of each community sample can be described by the multinomial (MN) distribution, which is parameterized by the previously mentioned two parameters. Testing the UNTB model is then computationally equivalent to testing the goodness-of-fitting to the MN distribution. However, a fully general case of fitting multiple sites UNTB with different immigration rates is computationally extremely challenging (actually intractable) even for small number of sites. In other words, to test the UNTB in truly multi-site (multiple local communities), approximate algorithms must be used(Harris et al. 2015). It wasHarris et al. (2015) that developed an efficient Bayesian fitting framework for testing the UNTB by approximating the neutral models with the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). For this reason, we refer to the computational framework developed byHarris et al. (2015) as HDP-MSN (hierarchical Dirichlet process-",

A lower M 0 may signal a lower threshold for the occurrence of outbreak, which may imply higher outbreak risk from a public health perspective. Previously, we have shown that COVID-19 appears to have a higher outbreak risk compared with SARS. Given that both of the coronaviruses appear to have virtually equal bvalues, then one wonders if they have any essential differences, revealed in this study, from the epidemiological or public-health perspectives. M 0 (infection critical threshold) seems to be such an effective indicator (property) for assessing outbreak threshold (risk). Our study suggested that COVID-19 possesses a lower infection critical threshold (M 0 ) than SARS does may be explained by its lower fatality rate compared with SARS. Obviously lower lethality to hosts should actually be favorable for the survival and spread of virus.Ma ZS & Taylor RAJ.
